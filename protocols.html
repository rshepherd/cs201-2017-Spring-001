            <h3><u>Attendance</u></h3>

            <p>I expect you to attend class and recitation. I will take attendance. If I notice you are not attending, I will notice and I will ask you to explain why. It is really in your best interest, as if you do not attend, I will presume you are not taking the course seriously and therefore will be unlikely to be sympathetic to requests for extensions or any other special requests.</p>

            <h3><u>Course Mailing List, NYU Classes and Piazza</u></h3>

            <p> All students are automatically signed up for the class mailing list, which will be used to announce
                operational details about the course. <strong>The mailing list is not for discussion of the subject 
                material.</strong> You can change your options on the mailing list 
                <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/options/csci_ua_0201_001_sp17">here</a>.</p>

            <p> Students will be signed up for Piazza, which is an online discussion forum specifically for classes.
                If you have a question, ask it there first, if a student does not answer within a short time, I will
                answer.
            </p>

            <p> There is also NYU Classes (access it via <a href="http://home.nyu.edu">NYU Home</a>) page for the
                course. I will post your grades there.
            </p>

            <!--<h3><u>Office Hours</u></h3>

            <p> My office hours are listed on the 'Home' section of this site. If you need to speak to
                me and are unable make it to office hours, then you can schedule a meeting with me and we can talk on

                    address. (That account is managed by Google)
                </li>
                <li>In the "Other calendars" text box, enter <strong>rjs471[at]nyu.edu</strong>

            </p>-->

            <h3><u>Grade</u></h3>
            <p>
                Grades will be based on:</br>
                <table style="width:15%;">
                    <tr><td>Quizzes, In-class Exercises, Attendance</td><td>10%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Homeworks & Labs</td><td>20%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Midterm</td><td>30%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Final</td><td>40%</td></tr>
                </table><br>
                (Percentages subject to change)
            </p>

            <h3><u>Homeworks</u></h3>
            <p>
                These will be smaller programming homeworks to reinforce specific concepts.
            </p>

            <h3><u>Quizzes</u></h3>
            <p>
                These will be given during recitations. Those will not be announced. 
                They will be based on assignments, readings and material covered in class. 
                <em>Quizzes cannot be made up.</em> If you are going to be absent for legitimate reason, you need to notify the TA in advance (not after the quiz is given).
            </p>

            <h3><u>In-class Exercises</u></h3>
            <p>
                These will be given during recitations. They will happen with some regularity and may be announced.
                They sometimes introduce new material, but you will be given instruction and be able to use the internet 
                to help you figure things out. They may be team exercises. They will be graded on a 0-3 scale 
                (0 - no submission, 1 - submitted, but incorrect/incomplete, 2 - solution is on the right
                track, but not complete or only partially correct, 3 - correct solution). 
            </p>
               
            <h3><u>Labs</u></h3>
            <p>
                There will be multiple labs to complete during the semester. 
                These will be large assignments involving programing and problem solving. 
            </p>
        
            <h3>Exams</h3>   
            <p>
                There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for students who have a legitimate medical or personal emergency (documented). These students need to talk to the instructor as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam absence a week after it happened will not work).
            </p>

            <h3><u>Grade Scale</u></h3>
            <p>
                Grades will be determined using the following scale (note the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29#Including_or_excluding_endpoints" target="new">interval notation</a>):</br>
                <table style="width:15%;">
                    <tr><td>A</td><td>[90,100]</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>B+</td><td>[87,90)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>B</td><td>[83,87)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>B-</td><td>[80,83)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>C+</td><td>[77,80)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>C</td><td>[73,77)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>C-</td><td>[70,73)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>D</td><td>[65,70)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>F</td><td>[0,65)</td></tr>
                </table>
            </p>

            <h3><u>Grade Disputes</u></h3>

            <p> If you have a concern about a grade on an homework or an exam and want to discuss it with me, do it in
                person during my office hours. Please do not email me about it, as I will just tell you this.
            </p>
          
            <h3><u>Late Policy</u></h3>

            <p> Homework must be submitted before the announced date and time deadline
                for full credit. For every 24 hours late you lose 5% (so it is better to submit correct homework late
                than incorrect homework on time), with a
                max lateness of 15%. Late homework will not be accepted after the late deadline.
            </p>

            <h3><u>Broken Submission Policy</u></h3>

            <p>If you hand in an assignment that does not compile or crashes when it is run, you will get a grade of zero on it. As you are working on your code, make sure that it compiles and does what you expect it to do. Test frequently, not only after you write all the code.
            </p>

            <h3><u>Email Correspondence Policy</u></h3>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
                    to another email account that you use regularly.
                </li>
                <li>Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
                    administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
                    not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
                    one after another because you forgot something in the first one.
                </li>
                <li>Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
                    typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3><u>Academic Integrity</u></h3>

            <p> All students should submit their OWN work unless
                a group project has been assigned. Any additional
                references that are consulted besides the course text
                must be acknowledged. Students who violate the policy will be reported to the
                Dean for disciplinary action. If in doubt about consulting
                other students in the class with questions, please ask me.

                    The department academic integrity policy is here. </a>
